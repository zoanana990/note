# Note

This is a note for something i do not know what i need to place,
including:
- [algorithm](./algorithm/README.md), some skill for google
- features, e.g. `malloc`, `rcu` etc.
- performance comparision, e.g. `strlen`, `sort`, `stree` etc.
- docs, And here are some link I feel which are good to read

Please remember this is a note, just a note, not a big project
