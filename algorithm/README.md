# Questions

This list is based on [Grind 169](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=28&hours=6&grouping=topics#)
However, it will be reset when the brower is closed, so this is the place I record the subjects I made

## Interview
Please watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&ab_channel=LifeatGoogle) video.

There are several points in the video:
1. Ask for clarification to the problem, if you don't know about the question, please feel free to ask for clarification
2. He thought out loud(自言自語) constantly is probably the best thing you can do in the interview, becauase it gives the interviewee the opportunity see your thought process and use that to crourse-correct you more towards the question. This may let you have some new idea
3. Think everything before you start coding, you might be challenged by the interviwer to think better faster or quicker
4. Test your solution in real, think about edge case
5. When we are trying to approach a problem, **we should always start from brute force solution**, even though you have been trained by solving a lot of similar problems previously

- [2023 台灣 Google 軟體工程師面試心得 — 刷題要刷到什麼程度才有機會通過面試](https://medium.com/yuanchiehcheng/yet-another-google-swe-%E9%9D%A2%E8%A9%A6%E5%BF%83%E5%BE%97-2023-05-18eb13a73b75)

節錄：
> 1.熟悉基本語法與題型
> 
> 像我 C++ 平常工作都沒用上，需要花時間去熟悉 STL libray 的使用以及每個操作的時間複雜度
> 
> 基本題型如 array / linked list / sliding window / Dynamic Programing 等先將 150 題刷過一遍
> 
> 這一階段大概一題 medium 30 分鐘左右，成功率 70%，其餘 30% 就去看詳解學習
> 
> 2.看到主題就想到模板
> 
> 接下來進入第二遍刷題，此時看到主題基本就能蠻流暢解出來，同一個主題刷個 5 ~ 10 題基本就能抓出解題的模板 (不是死背)，像是 Binary Search / Sliding Window / BFS / DFS / DP 大概看到就知道哪些資料結構跟流程是必備的，如 BFS 基本就是 queue + visited set → 初始化哪些東西放進 queue → 怎麼找 neighbor + 標記 visited
> 
> 這個階段會額外要求 coding style 部分，基本的變數名稱、排版等都要注意，畢竟面試不單純題目寫完，而是要展現自身的工程能力
> 
> 此時大概 medium 25 ~ 30 分鐘解完，成功率大概 85%
> 參加週賽偶爾卡住，但 1e1m 應該沒問題
> 
> 3.清晰掌握題目
> 
> 接著進入第三遍刷題，這一階段基本上看到題目可以很快展開不同的情境，很直覺的推斷出解題思路，比較具體的展現如 853. Car Fleet、1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit，這兩題我蠻喜歡的，第一次解花蠻多時間，但到這個階段我最一開始把 test case 列完，心中大概就有個解題的雛形
